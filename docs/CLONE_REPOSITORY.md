# Clone repository

There are two options, cloning via HTTPS or via SSH. HTTPS is recommended.

If using HTTPS, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet.git
```

Alternatively, instruct the IDE to clone: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet.git`

Note that authentication with your password is not possible due to 2FA authentication and repository visibility.
Consider setting up GitHub integration on your IDE or using a personal [access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

For SSH cloning you need to [setup SSH authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) properly.
Then you should be able to run:

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet.git
```
