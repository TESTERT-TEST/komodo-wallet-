# QuBitcoin Wallet v0.9.0 Release Notes

We are excited to announce QuBitcoin Wallet v0.9.0. This release introduces HD wallet functionality, cross-platform fiat on-ramp improvements, a new feedback provider, and numerous bug fixes and dependency upgrades.

Under the hood, the app has undergone a major rewrite to migrate to our new KDF Flutter SDK. This also allows developers to quickly and easily build their own DeFi applications in a matter of hours instead of months. See the [SDK package](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-sdk-flutter) for more information.
